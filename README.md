- Any user can list tickets for sale and purchase tickets
- When a user attempts to purchase a ticket, the ticket is "locked" for 15 minutes. The user has 15 minutes to enter their payment info
- While a ticket is locked, no other user can purchase that ticket. After 15 minutes, that ticket should "unlock"
- Ticket prices can be edited if they are not locked
